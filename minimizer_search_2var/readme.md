# Searching for a minimizer of a 2-variable function.

This work uses Newton's method to find search directions for finding a minimizer. The line search algorithm is the golden section search. If Newton's method does not work, use the steepest descent instead.

Newton's method is contained in a function `Newton.m`. For further details, please refer to the report in a PDF format.

The golden line search subproblem is given in `golden.m`.

The optimized function is contained in `FunctionName.m`.

To test the code, please run `script_test.m`

You can see the report in a PDF file. I also give the LaTeX file that generates that PDF.

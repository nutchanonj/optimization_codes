# Searching minimizer of 2-variable function.

This work uses Newton's method to find search directions for finding minimizer. The line search algorithm is golden section search. If Newton's method does not work, use the steepest descent instead.

The Newton's method is contained in a function `Newton.m`. For further detail, please refer to the report in a pdf format.

The golden line search subproblem is given in `golden.m`.

The optimized function is contained in `FunctionName.m`.

To test the code, please run `script_test.m`

You can see the report in pdf file. I also give the LaTeX file gererating that pdf.

# Newton's method used to find the root of a system of equations.

The algorithm is contained in a function `newton.m`.

The optimized function is contained in `FunctionName.m`.

To test the code, please run `script_test.m`

You can see the report in a PDF file. I also give the LaTeX file that generates that PDF.
